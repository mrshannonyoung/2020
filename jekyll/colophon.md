When used in reference to Web sites, a colophonis a description of the tools, systems and resources used to create the Web site and keep it operational. The colophon serves to acknowledge and give credit to all the resources that combined to produce the specific site. A site typically will devote a separate page to detailing its colophon.

A colophon can include but is not limited to any software and hardware that was used to create the site, the type of server that the site is running off of, the types of scripts that are running the site and the programming languages of the scripts, the operating system the site is based on, any industry standards that the site adheres to, when the site was launched and how often it is updated, the names of the administrators of the site or the editorial team that provides its content and any other acknowledgments the site��s administrators want to share with its visitors.

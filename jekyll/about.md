# The human

Hi, welcome to a badly written section about me.

I'm well into accessibility and user experience. I have worked as a front-end designer and developer for 13 years. As lines blur between job titles and role responsibilities 

I have deep interests in anything related to the web and development, mainly based around Front-end techniques and best practices.

- Accessible.
- Semantic.
- Inclusive.
- Performant.

During that time span I have 

## What I stand for

* Accessiblity and Inclusivity
* Open/Collaborative working
* Semantics / Interop (schema, microdata)  
* Performance - webpagetest
* Privacy security
* https://yellowlab.tools/
* https://cssstats.com/
* https://observatory.mozilla.org/

## What I'm about

* Users first
* People don't come to 'navigate' a site
* Content is King
* There is no web without HTML
* empower and enable
* Fun â€“Â A smile in the mind. Source code cheekiness.
* That

## What I'm not about

* Overly complicated
* CSS-in-JS ðŸ¤¢
* Client rendered JS SPA's

## Working mentality

* I have good aesthetic sensibilities as well an understanding of back-end development that allows close collaboration with the team.
* Learning emerging techniques and technologies and pushing for the appropriate levels of adoption.
* Support consistency between projects by maintaining coding standards documentation.
* Using a pattern library to develop modules to better communicate to the team.
* Ensuring functionality of projects across browsers and devices.
* Breaking down projects into components and estimating for work effectively.
* Writing functional specifications, guiding complexity and scope of project
* Identifying problems in wireframes and designs to mitigate rework down the line
* Working with Design, UX and Back-end to deliver projects in HTML, CSS and JavaScript following a Progressive Enhancement strategy.

## Brag sheet

I was told by my hairdresser that these are a good idea.

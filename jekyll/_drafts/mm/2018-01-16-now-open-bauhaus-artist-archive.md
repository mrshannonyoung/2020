## The internet has truly disrupted the way intellectual property is handled.

**Some is guarded more closely than ever before (see product formulae like the one for Coca-Cola). Some is splashed about for the benefit of everyone (see the WordPress content management system).**

Now, the source materials for one important artist’s teaching are freely available to everyone with an internet connection.

Paul Klee, a 19th- and 20th-century painter strongly connected to the Bauhaus movement, left behind more than 9,000 works of art and around 3,900 pages of notes: source material for a decade of teaching from 1921-1931. Zentrum Paul Klee has just made his teaching notes freely available to the public, as a resource for those looking to learn about the Bauhaus movement.

If you decide to browse through this shiny new-old archive, you might not immediately engage with “his extensively detailed textual theorizing on the mechanics of art”, but as the writer at [OpenCulture][1] says, his illustrations of these mechanics in their “vividness, clarity, and reflection of a truly active mind, can still captivate anybody”.

It’s great to see iconic design thinkers get recognised, and to watch their insights being shared among a community full of people thirsty to learn. In a prime example of a collaborative and open design culture, Paul Klee’s extensive teaching notes are now there for free on the internet, to help another generation of design students make their mark.

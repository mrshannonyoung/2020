All the big companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft are doing it, so you should be too right. Right?

Flat design, summarised into one paragraph is this:

> A design focussed around simplifying elements and removing the unnecessary decorations such as textures, drop shadows, and bevels. In doing so, the user experience should be more defined and the UI intuitive.

The beta of the new operating system for iPhone’s and iPad’s (iOS7) is a good, recent, high-profile example.

## Apple (iOS7 Beta)

Before you jump ship and “flatten all the things” or you hear the dreaded “make it look like the iPhone”, consider a few points first.

  * Making everything flat in the wrong way could confuse users and hamper usability.
  * Flat design will not fix core issues; if your content is unclear and your processes are unintuitive, you may need to re-work the UI design altogether and perform some user testing with wireframes.
  * Is it really right for your brand?

In my opinion, the reason people prefer flat design is down to a few factors.

### Less visual clutter

By doing away with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph#Digital_skeuomorphs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skeuomorphism</a> and stripping back all the Web 2.0 effects (glossy, gradients, insane drop shadows with inner shadows, and heavy use of textures) we can clearly process what is in front of us, making for a more simplistic and minimalist view.

### Softer palettes

The use of lighter colour schemes and pastel-like colours make the design feel more lightweight and friendly.

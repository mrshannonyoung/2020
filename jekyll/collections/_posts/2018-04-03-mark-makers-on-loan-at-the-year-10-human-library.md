**A Human Library gives students the chance to borrow a human “book” for a short time to learn about their job, workplace and sector. It’s a great opportunity for students to ask questions about career choices and pathways, qualifications and experience, and what the job is actually like day-to-day.**

## Back to school

At the end of March, volunteers from 17 local businesses gathered at Chipping Norton School to be “books” in the “Human Library” organised for Year 10 by the Oxfordshire Local Enterprise ([OxLEP][1]) Skills Team.

Mark-makers Shannon and Tom (who’s also an alumnus of the school) were among them!

Here’s how they got on&#8230;

### Shannon

Just the chance to experience a school dinner again was good enough reason to go to Chipping Norton school and speak about my career. That and my motivation to inspire a whole new generation of young coders. I was looking forward to giving them an idea of what to expect out in the world.

Immediately I noticed that a couple of things have changed since I was at school:

  1. It’s no longer called “information technology” &#8211; it’s “computer science”
  2. You have to prepay a card in order to get school dinner
  3. And kids these days – so confident!

### Tom

The week before Shannon and I were asked to share our experiences at the school where my curiosity for art and design began to form, Craig Oldham released a book called Oh Sh*t&#8230; What Now?: Honest Advice for New Graphic Designers. In this book that I’d have died to find during my time in education, Craig shares his own experiences, ideas, advice, criticism and encouragement.

Having gleaned so much from even the first few pages, I wondered for a moment what I had to offer? But it ultimately inspired me all the more to spill what beans I have to offer, and inspire and encourage budding designers in whatever way I could.

Returning to my old stomping ground, walking the same narrow corridors and talking to teachers that taught during my time, I felt a sense of duty to listen and share not only mark-making*s journey but my own experiences. Rolling back the years, I remember being at the stage these Year 10s found themselves in: the uncertainty and the constant questions about what you intend to do with your future.

## The nitty gritty

### Tom

With 24 groups of students in a 4 hour time period, I was concerned that Shannon and I might find the talk we’d prepped a little monotonous after a while. But in truth each group brought a new challenge, fresh questions and interesting perceptions of what we at mark-making* are all about.

You couldn’t knock the students’ enthusiasm, even if one question that came up time and again was salaries. (Not exactly a topic you share with friends down the pub on a Friday night, let alone a group of teenagers you’d never met before.) In a time where job uncertainty and living costs seem to be on the rise it would appear even at the very first hurdle students’ eyes are on the money, possibly over and above the pathways or new opportunities that an entry-level position could put at their disposal.

### Shannon

So, after I was firmly established as a dinosaur, me and Tom spoke about our jobs. I was straight up with them. I wanted them to feel that they could still achieve what they wanted, even if things don’t work out quite how they want in school. I told them about my journey from having no idea what I wanted to do with my not-so brilliant GCSEs, to leaving college with decent grades and an idea of what kind of job I wanted.

I enjoy talking about being a developer, it’s so rewarding encouraging others that they can create and be creative with code, that this is something they can learn and practise outside of formal education. The web can be a very forgiving medium, so it’s a great place to learn and try things out.

The gender gap in web development is massive, so when there were female students in the group, I made sure to let them know these stats that show just what a great opportunity there is for women in tech:

  * From a survey of over 100k developers 14k were students and only 7.4% of that 14k were female
  * The fact that the majority of people I look up to within my industry are female seemed to be a surprise. 
      * Lea Verou
      * Rachel Andrew
      * Sarah Parmenter
      * Karen McGrane
      * Laura Kalbag

I mentioned that Google have launched a ‘[Women Techmakers Program][2]’ to provide a community and resources for women in tech and there are also initiatives such as ‘[Girls who code][3]’, ‘[Code like a girl][4]’ and various code clubs all around the U.K.

I even aired my (genius) idea that spoken modern languages should be binned in favour of more functional code languages. I got them all on side in the end (apart from that kid who chose GCSE French &#8211; sorry dude).

## So, how was it?

### Shannon

Being given the opportunity to talk to students about being a developer was great &#8211; I’d love to go back and have a more in-depth chat with any who are keen to do a job like mine. Credit goes to the students, they were all polite and the majority of them engaged in the conversation and seemed to be interested in our various roles and responsibilities at mark-making*.

After speaking to ~170 students, I was keen to look up what was being [taught for GCSE Computer Science][5]…they should be renamed GeeeeshCSEs. This is the kind of stuff I was being taught in college!

But that’s great &#8211; it all seemed relevant and based on real-world stuff. And it harks back to another favourite stat of mine: almost 90% of developers teach themself a new language, framework or tool outside of formal education.

### Tom

Representing mark-making* outside of the studio was a new experience, one I thoroughly enjoyed. Credit where credit’s due, Chipping Norton School put on a great event. I certainly took great confidence from talking to the next generation and wish a similar event had been in place during my time. Leaving through the green school gates, I reflected on the event and found myself pondering how many students will have been influenced or given food for thought, pleased to have been part of yet another cool event helps others make their mark.

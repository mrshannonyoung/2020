## Universal

Accessibility isn't just for people with a disability, impairment or specialised needs.

Everyone has abilities, and limits to those abilities. Designing for people with permanent disabilities actually results in designs that benefit everyone universally.

### Standards

As an advocate for web standards, I have ensured my website is W3C standards-compliant*, browsers that adhere to these standards should be capable of navigating this site.

*There are minor disagreements with the `role` element being 'unnecessary' so warning level indicators exist for them. Also the `importance` attribute for [Priority Hints][3]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} which are for performance.

### Conformance

The website has been tested to [WCAG 2][1]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} AA conformance level.

> Although these guidelines [WCAG 2] cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability.

### Assistive technologies

In addition to being tested on modern browsers, this site has been checked for screen reader ease of use using Voiceâ€ŠOver (feedback from NVDA and JAWS users is welcomed). It is also audited using WAVE, and axe accessibility testing services.

### Always learning

While every effort has been made to make all content accessible, should you come across an issue, please get in touch. I'm always eager learn.

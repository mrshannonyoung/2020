## Impact

Accessibility isn't just for people with a disability, impairment or specialised needs.

Everyone has abilities, and limits to those abilities. Designing for people with permanent disabilities actually results in designs that benefit everyone universally.

### Conformance

The website has been tested to [WCAG 2][1]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}

#### Weee

> Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability.

While every effort has been made to make all content accessible, should you come accross an issue, please get in touch.
